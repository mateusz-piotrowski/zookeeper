This is particularly useful when creating classes or functions that need to handle different data types but perform similar operations. The type parameter can be used in methods and properties of the class, and the actual type is determined when an object is created from the generic class.">generic</a> ordered collection of elements that supports adding, removing, and updating operations. Here are some of the common operations:</p>

list.add(4) // list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>add at index</strong>: Inserts an element at a specified index.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">list.add(1, 5) // list becomes [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>remove</strong>: Removes an element from the list.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">list.remove(5) // list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>removeAt</strong>: Removes an element at a specified index.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">list.removeAt(0) // list becomes [2, 3, 4]</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>set</strong>: Updates an element at a specified index.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">list.set(1, 10) // list becomes [2, 10, 4]</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>clear</strong>: Removes all elements from the list.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">list.clear() // list becomes []</code></pre></li></ul>
<p>These operations allow for dynamic and flexible manipulation of collections in Kotlin, making <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> a powerful tool for developers.</p>
<h5 id="the-role-of-mutability-in-lists-and-when-to-utilize-mutablelist">The Role of Mutability in Lists and When to Utilize MutableList</h5>
<p>Mutability in lists is a vital feature that enables dynamic alterations of the list's content. In Kotlin, a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> is an interface that expands the <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> interface, including methods that alter the list, like <code class="language-kotlin">add</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">remove</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">clear</code>. Here's a demonstration of a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> at work:</p>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">val mutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3) mutableList.add(4) // The list now contains [1, 2, 3, 4]</code></p>
<p>On the flipside, a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a read-only is a property that can only be read and not modified. | It is declared using the `val` keyword, which indicates that the property is immutable and can only be assigned a value once during initialization. This helps ensure the integrity of the data and prevent unintended modification. Additionally, read-only properties can be used to expose internal state in a safe and controlled manner, without allowing external code to modify it. This immutability offers protection against unintended alteration, making your code more error-prone and simpler to comprehend.">read-only</a> <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> in Kotlin does not permit such alterations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val readOnlyList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
// readOnlyList.add(4) // This would lead to a compilation error</code></pre>
<p>You should utilize a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> when you anticipate the elements of your list to change over time. This is especially handy when dealing with a collection of items of unknown size initially, or when the list elements need frequent updates, additions, or removals according to the program logic.</p>
<p>In contrast, pick a read-only <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> when you're working with a specific set of elements that shouldn't change. This immutability offers protection against unintended alterations, making your code less error-prone and simpler to comprehend.</p>
<p>In summary, deciding between a mutable and read-only list in Kotlin depends on whether the list's content is expected to be altered post its creation. Choose <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> when modifications are needed and a read-only <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> for stability and immutability.</p>
<h5 id="iterating-over-a-mutablelist-in-kotlin">Iterating over a MutableList in Kotlin</h5>
<p>A MutableList in Kotlin is a collection type that you can modify; you can add, remove, or update elements. Iterating over a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> and executing <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/14879" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a batch operation refers to a type of operation that involves processing multiple items or data elements in a single operation, particularly in the context of reactive programming with flows. | Batch operations are useful for improving the performance and efficiency of processing large amounts of data by reducing the overhead of individual operations. In the context of threading, batch operations can help avoid thread interference by ensuring that multiple threads do not modify shared data simultaneously. By processing data in batches, threads can operate on separate portions of data without interfering with each other. In the context of flows, batch operations can be used to process data in chunks or batches, allowing for more efficient processing and better handling of backpressure. Flows can be configured to emit data in batches, allowing downstream operations to process multiple elements at once.">batch operations</a> are typical tasks in Kotlin programming.</p>
<h5 id="iteration">Iteration</h5>
<p>You can use a <code class="language-kotlin">for</code> loop to go through a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val mutableList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for (item in mutableList) {
    println(item)
}</code></pre>
<p>You also have the option to use the <code class="language-kotlin">forEach</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">mutableList.forEach { item -&gt;
    println(item)
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="batch-operations">Batch Operations</h5>
<p>You can perform batch operations using functions like <code class="language-kotlin">map</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">filter</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">forEach</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val lengths = mutableList.map { it.length }</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val longFruits = mutableList.filter { it.length &gt; 5 }</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">mutableList.forEach { println(it.toUpperCase()) }</code></pre>
<ul><li><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">map</code> function modifies each element:</p></li><li><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">filter</code> function retains elements that fulfill a condition:</p></li><li><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">forEach</code> function carries out an action on each element:</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="modifying-lists">Modifying Lists</h5>
<p>You can modify elements in a batch using <code class="language-kotlin">replaceAll</code>. This requires API level 24 or higher on Android:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">mutableList.replaceAll { it.toUpperCase() }</code></pre>
<p>If you are using earlier <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/14879" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a version refers to a specific release or iteration of the programming language that has been developed and made available for use. | It is represented by a number or a string that indicates the level of improvements, bug fixes, or new features introduced in that version compared to the previous ones. For instance, Kotlin 1.4.20 is a version that follows Kotlin 1.4.10, and it may contain enhancements, corrections, or additional functionalities that were not present in the earlier version.">versions</a> of Android or Kotlin, a combination of <code class="language-kotlin">map</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">clear</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">addAll</code> will work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val upperCaseList = mutableList.map { it.toUpperCase() }
mutableList.clear()
mutableList.addAll(upperCaseList)</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind, batch operations like <code class="language-kotlin">map</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">filter</code> that transform the list, yield a new list; they don't change the original <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code>.</p>
<p>Kotlin provides excellent tools to work with <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code>, simplifying tasks like iterating over the list and carrying out batch operations efficiently.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The MutableList in Kotlin is a dynamic and flexible collection type that gives you the ability to change the list's contents after it's been created. This makes it a perfect choice for situations where the size and elements of the list may change during a program's execution. With helpful functions like <code class="language-kotlin">add</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">remove</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">set</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">clear</code>, you have the capability to adjust lists according to your requirements.</p>
